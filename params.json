The results are pretty good but can be a little aggressive sometimes. Now that everything is pretty much running I'm going to be working on tweaking and extending the range of glitches.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\nMany thanks to @michaelhelmick for the [python-tumblpy](https://github.com/michaelhelmick/python-tumblpy) library. It's solid, light weight and saved me a lot of time.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you want to ask me anything then just drop an email to contact@rumblesan.com"}
